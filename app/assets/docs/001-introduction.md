# Introduction to Peercoin

Hello, and welcome to the Peercoin Documentation website! We hope to help you understand more about this coin, its philosopy and the technologies that run behind it. Before getting too technical, we invite you to dive a little bit into the history of Peercoin, learning why it was created, and the purposes behind it.

## History

### Peercoin Genesis: 2012

Since the creation of Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2008), proof-of-work has been the predominant design of peer-to-peer crypto currency. The concept of proof-of-work has been the backbone of minting and security model of Nakamotoâ€™s design.

### Peercoin 0.6: 2017

Might be worth talking about the changes and the hard fork mechanism we used. This also marked the end of the Peerunity Project.

### Peercoin Foundation: 2018

A legal entity formed for the advancement of Peercoin.

## Philosophy

I'm not entirely sure what we want to put here. "To Make Fair Digital Money"?

Before the advent of cryptocurrency sending money across the world was slow and expensive. Global access to an always available, always fair financial network feels like a human right in the modern era. Peercoin is able to maintain this vision since it is built by volunteers and actively pursues technological decisions that keep the network open and accessible.

## Technology

Build an explanation of the underlying technologies without going into great detail. Article #002-comparison-with-other-blockchains goes into more depth. We might also want to write an article for developers that elaborates more and points to technical resources.
